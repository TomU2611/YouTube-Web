to run the project:

1. navigate to the 'my-yt-web' folder
2. run 'npm i'
3. run 'npm start'


Web project process:

At first, everyone worked separately on different pages, writing simple page logic and design.
Tom worked on the Login and Register page, Mark worked on everything related to the homepage and Itay worked on on the videoList, videoItems and addVIdeo page.

Afterward, Mark and Itay continued the Android project while Tom worked on connecting all the different components and implementing all the necessary logic for the site to work (routing, handling all the states, user interaction, etc).

some side notes:
-some of the functionalities are in a drop down menu on the left of the topbar
-we chose to do a purple(ish) dark mode, it's not very polished but it looks better than just putting a lot of grey and black
